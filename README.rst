Read the Docs - ext-theme
=========================

This package aims to be a drop in replacement for the current site templates for
Read the Docs. This will replace the entire UI of Read the Docs, replacing a lot
of one-off template HTML and CSS with established patterns, backed by a lot of
heavy lifting from SemanticUI.

Documentation can be found here: https://read-the-docs-ext-theme.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html




.. warning::
    This package is alpha level quality, is not ready for use, and is not a
    great place to contribute to Read the Docs currently. These templates will
    likely be merged back into core code in the future.
