What is this?
-------------

This repository is the next generation dashboard for the Read the Docs
application. Read the Docs Community users can try this new dashboard by
visiting https://beta.readthedocs.org and logging in with their normal user
account. It is added as a Django application to an existing Read the Docs
instance.

On the technical side, it is a replacement set of templates, JavaScript code,
and stylesheets that replaces the legacy dashboard used by both Read the Docs
Community and Read the Docs for Business.

Where to start?
---------------

Each of the major components are documented on their own:

- :doc:`templates`
- :doc:`javascript`
- :doc:`stylesheets`
