Read the Docs -- Application theme
==================================

Also known as: ``readthedocsext-theme``.

This is an addition to the ``readthedocsext`` package, and provides an
alternative theme for the application UI. This package includes updated templates
and new JavaScript sources, though still sticks to most of the patterns and
tools already used in the application templates.
