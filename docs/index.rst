Phase I
    Redo templates using SemanticUI (SUI) and move build system to use Webpack.
    There are several pages where we'll hold off on overhauling the UX of the
    page, and will instead implement the page as it currently exists. A more
    thoughtful redesign of the UX will happen in phase II, when we start
    applying more polish to some pages.

Phase II
    During this phase, we'll start to address polish a bit more. We'll address
    UX on some of our more difficult pages, especially where it will require
    code changes. Also apply a more graphical elements and more personality to
    our landing pages and marketing pages where applicable.
