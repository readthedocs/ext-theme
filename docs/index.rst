Read the Docs -- Application theme
==================================

Also known as: ``readthedocsext-theme``.

This is meant as an extension to ``readthedocsext`` for now. The templates and
asset source files will/may eventually be part of Read the Docs application core
code, but are maintained in separate package/namespace while development is
still in a alpha/beta phase.

The documentation here is meant to aid in development, and describes many of the
patterns used throughout the templates and our JavaScript.
