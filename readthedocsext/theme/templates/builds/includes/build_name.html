  Build name
  ==========

  ``builds/includes/build_name.html``

  A common include for showing the build name in a heading or title

  This is a more complex heading than other elements. It uses a breadcrumb to
  show the version the build was for, as well as the type of build in the case
  that build is for a pull request version.

  When used as a page title, on the build detail page, show some extra text and
  nested breadcrumbs that we don't need to show in the build listing. This
  gives some UI to link back to the build list or the version list. Normally,
  the whole breadcrumb is linked as single link.

  Template parameters
  -------------------

  .. describe:: build

     The build instance to generate a name/header for.

  .. describe:: is_page_title

      **Boolean, default=False**. Add full build breadcrumbs and link each
      section separately. This is used in the build detail page, where we want
      the breadcrumbs to act more like breadcrumbs and want to link back to the
      list of version builds. On the build listing page, we only want to link
      to the build detail page for the build.
