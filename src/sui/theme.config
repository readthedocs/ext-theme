// This path is very intention and shouldn't be changed. We have multiple
// include paths set up in the less-loader (see webpack.config.mjs), and all
// these paths contain a theme in the location `themes/{theme_name}`. By using
// ordered include paths, less-loader will try to resolve the theme location in
// the correct order, even if that theme is not in the expected path of:
// `node_modules/fomantic-ui-less/themes/`
@themesFolder: "themes";

// This is the path to the `rtd-application` theme folder, which is now included
// as a site folder instead of a theme. The effect is the same however. This
// resolves using the first less-loader path in Webpack.
@siteFolder: "src/sui/themes/rtd-application/";
